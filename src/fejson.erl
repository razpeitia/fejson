%% API

% NIF functions end up overriding the functions defined in this module. But
% this module must define the functions we want the NIF to implement.
% Theoretically this won't ever get called as out on_load function init/0
% should raise an error if we have issues.
%
% A really nice person would make a pure Erlang fallback incase a NIF was
% unable to load for a specific platform.

encode(_) -> not_loaded(?LINE).
decode(_) -> not_loaded(?LINE).

%% Iternal functions

% Since we used init/0 in our -on_load() preprocessor directive, this
% function will get called as the module is loaded. This is the perfect
% place to load up our NIF shared library. Handily, the response of
% erlang:load_nif/2 matches the return specification for -on_load()
% functions.

init() ->
    PrivDir = case code:priv_dir(?MODULE) of
        {error, _} ->
            EbinDir = filename:dirname(code:which(?MODULE)),
            AppPath = filename:dirname(EbinDir),
            filename:join(AppPath, "priv");
        Path ->
            Path
    end,
    erlang:load_nif(filename:join(PrivDir, "fejson"), 0).

% This is just a simple place holder. It mostly shouldn't ever be called
% unless there was an unexpected error loading the NIF shared library.

not_loaded(Line) ->
    exit({not_loaded, [{module, ?MODULE}, {line, Line}]}).
